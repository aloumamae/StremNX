# Changelog

## 0.3.1 (2026-10-19)

- Fix: subtitles from addons often did not show up. OpenSubtitles v3 (the official Stremio subtitles addon) is now
  always available, even when it is not on your account or you are not logged in
- Fix: subtitle files and downloaded videos are passed to the player with a path it always understands
- The player says so when there are no subtitles in your language for a video
- Fix: the app could freeze while a stream was stalled (torrent without peers, slow link). The player no longer
  waits on mpv for its state.
- Fix: the torrent engine could stall waiting for network packets, freezing the screen with it
- Fix: pausing or deleting a download no longer holds the screen
- A watchdog writes to `log.txt` where the app got stuck if it ever freezes for more than 4 seconds
